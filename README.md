# Slim Framework Starter Template

A lightweight MVC web application starter template built on top of the Slim PHP microframework. Perfect for when you want the simplicity of Slim but with a proper MVC structure to keep your code organized and maintainable.

## Why Using this Template?

This template gives you a solid foundation to build web applications using the Slim 4 framework with a classic MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It's got everything you need to get started without the bloat of larger frameworks.

## What's Included

This starter template follows best practices and adheres to industry standards:

- **Slim 4**: The "slim" PHP microframework
- **Routing**: Slim's custom routing based on [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute)
- **Dependency injection container** (PSR-11)
- **HTTP message interfaces** (PSR-7)
- **HTTP Server Request Handlers**, Middleware (PSR-15)
- **Autoloader** (PSR-4)
- **Logger** (PSR-3)
- **Code styles** (PSR-12)
- **Composer** - Dependency management

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer (for dependency management)
- A web server (Apache, Nginx)

## How Do I Use/Deploy this Template?

Follow the instructions below in the specified order:

1. Download this repository as `.zip` file.
2. Extract the downloaded `slim-mvc-main.zip` file locally.
3. Copy the `slim-mvc-main` folder into your Web server's **document root** (that is, `htdocs`)
4. Rename the `slim-mvc-main` folder to, for example, `[project_name]-app`. For example, `worldcup-app`
5. Open your `[project_name]-app` folder in VS Code
6. If you are using Wampoon, open a terminal window in VS Code (hit ``` Ctrl+` ```) and select `Command Prompt` dropdown menu in the upper-right corner. Then run `../../composer.bat update` command to install or update the required dependencies.
   - If you are not using Wampoon to develop your app, just run composer from the command line.
7. Adjust your database credentials, **see below**.

**```NOTE:```** You can always clone this repository. However, if you do, you need to remove the ```.git``` ***hidden*** directory before you copy this template over to ```htdocs```

## How Do I Configure My Database Connection?

Follow the outlined instructions in [config/env.example.php](config/env.example.php)

* Change the value of the `database` variable to reflect the name of the database to be used by your slim app.
* You may also want to change the connection credentials in that file.

## On Using Environment Variables

Sensitive information used in app such as your database credentials, API key, etc. MUST not be pushed into your Git repo.

Do not use `.env` files for storing environment specific application settings/configurations. Dotenv [is not meant to be used in production](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv/issues/76#issuecomment-87252126)

Just Google: "DB_PASSWORD" filetype:env
Alternatively, you can visit the following link: [Google env search](https://www.google.ch/search?q=%22DB_PASSWORD%22+filetype:env)

Instead, follow the instructions that are detailed in [config/env.example.php](config/env.example.php)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** or download this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frostybee/slim-mvc.git your-project-name
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
   
   Or if you don't have Composer globally installed, use the included `composer.bat` (you might need to adjust the PHP path):
   ```bash
   composer.bat install
   ```

## Quick Development Tips

### Adding Routes

Routes are defined in the `app/Routes/` directory. Check out the existing route files to see how it's done.

### Creating Controllers

Controllers go in `app/src/Controllers/`. They should extend the base controller class and follow PSR-4 autoloading.

### Views and Templates

Templates are stored in `app/src/Views/`. The template engine is already configured and ready to use.

### Configuration

App configuration lives in `app/config/`. Modify these files to customize your application settings.

### Logging

Logs are written to the `var/logs/` directory. Use the injected logger in your controllers to track what's happening.

## Need Help?

- Check out the [Slim documentation](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/) for framework-specific questions.
- Look at the example controllers and routes to see how everything fits together.
- The code is pretty well commented, so don't hesitate to explore it well.
